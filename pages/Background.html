            <P>
                I have been classically trained on the Violin <br>
                for 10 years and on the Piano for 6 years. I <br>
                began cmposing in 2013.

                A Little About Myself
            </h3>
            <p>
                I began my studies in composition at Radford University <br>
                under the guidance of Dr. Bruce Mahin. My studies have had <br>
                me learn different forms of music from the Binary to the Tone <br>
                poem. I have entered into multiple competitions with my <br>
                works in the previous year. I seek to continue my education in <br>
                composition to the masterâ€™s level as soon as I graduate from <br>
                Radford.

                My Style
            </h3>
            <p>
                As a composer I have always been most influenced by the <br>
                works of Beethoven, Chopin, and Nobuo Uematsu. I knew <br>
                from the second I heard the crystal prelude from one of the <br>
                final fantasy games that I knew I wanted to be a composer. I <br>
                take a firm stance of taking what the old composers and new <br>
                composers have created and create a fusion of the two. <br>
