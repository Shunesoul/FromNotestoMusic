                    Education
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I studied music composition at Radford University. I have a firm <br>
                    understanding of musical harmony from the classical era to today’s <br>
                    modern era. I am a trained violinist and pianist as well. Originally I was <br>
                    training to be a music educator before switching to purely composition so <br>
                    I have a understanding of all typical instruments. I have received private <br>
                    musical instruction along with my college education.
